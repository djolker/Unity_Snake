Unity_Snake_Build_Info: 
"Zero Asset Snake", There's a strong possibility that this will become a non-snake game. It's slowly evolving into a strange potential 3D bullet-hell type. c'est la vie

Known Issues:
-Enemy does not bounce back on hits
-Player falls off edge (some sort of graceful solution needs to be made for this)
-Health object don't respawn
-Bullet splits happen only on one side for approx 180 degress on that side

Recent Changes:
-Shooting now happens continuously on the space bar being held, rather than on press. More bullets = more fun
-BounceBack now works pretty effectively. Decided to make this an effect on the player rather than the enemy, as getting hit is a negative action to the player, instead of something that should harm the enemy in anyway.
-Floor clipping happens less (due to less up knock items) but still an issue.  
-Health items have been created, scripts are still work in progress
-Bullets split per node pickup

Player Controls:
-WASD turns and moves player
-SPACE shoots bullet

Enemy Features:
-Can die
-Can respawn (through the GameMaster script)
-Gives 2 points to player on death
-Follows player
-hits remove 1 health per hit

Player Features:
-Score counts and displays properly
-Has health
-Can Die (game currently reacts properly to death)
-Bounce back works

ToDo:
-Enemy needs to rotate to player before moving forward
-Death sequence (including game over screen etc)
-Display health
-Nodes are redesigned now to give a sort of "Splitting" power-up, causing you to fire 1 more bullet per node picked up.  The angle calculator and item spawner needs to be fit into the current system
-Possibility of enemies attacking
